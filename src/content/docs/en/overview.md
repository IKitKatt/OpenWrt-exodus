title: Overview
description: What Exodus is, which routers it runs on and how it works.
---

Exodus is a proxy with the [Mihomo](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/mihomo) core for routers. Devices of the network go through the proxy without any setup on them: the router intercepts their traffic and hands it to the core, and the core decides by the rules of the profile what goes through the proxy and what goes directly.

The OpenWrt version is a fork of [OpenWrt-nikki](https://github.com/nikkinikki-org/OpenWrt-nikki). The Keenetic and Asus versions run in Entware and borrow ideas from [XKeen](https://github.com/jameszeroX/XKeen).

## Platforms

| Platform | Branch | UI | Replaces |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [OpenWrt](/en/install/openwrt/) 24.10+ | `main` | LuCI: Services → Exodus | Nikki |
| [Keenetic / Netcraze](/en/install/keenetic/) | `keenetic` | [own web UI](/en/usage/web-ui/), port 9099 | XKeen |
| [Asus with Asuswrt-Merlin](/en/install/asuswrt/) | `asuswrt` | [own web UI](/en/usage/web-ui/), port 9099 | XRAYUI and similar |

Exodus has one version for all routers, the version of the [release](https://github.com/prettyleaf/openwrt-exodus/releases).

## Features

- TCP through Redirect or TPROXY, UDP through TPROXY, IPv4 and IPv6. TUN on OpenWrt as well.
- Device selection: proxy all except the selected devices, or only the selected ones. On Keenetic and Asus also network segments and Wi-Fi networks.
- [Subscriptions](/en/usage/subscriptions/) updated by the interval of the provider, provider headers (title, announce, logo, traffic) and HWID for panels with a device limit.
- Your own rules and a [mixin file](/en/usage/overrides/) over the profile, an editor of the files on the router.
- DSCP marks to choose the route per application (Keenetic, Asus).
- Choice of the core: Mihomo Meta, Mihomo Alpha or Prizrak-Core.
- Updates from the UI and installation through your own [gh-proxy](/en/install/options/#if-github-is-blocked) when the provider blocks GitHub.
- The Zashboard dashboard (or MetaCubeXD, YACD) to choose proxies and watch connections.

The specifics of each firmware are on its installation page.
