description: The pages of Exodus in LuCI on OpenWrt.
---

On OpenWrt Exodus is set up in LuCI: **Services → Exodus**. Two pages are enough to get it working — Profile and App Config.

## App Config

- **Status**: versions of the app and the core, the state of the core, the Restart Service and Open Dashboard buttons. The announce of the provider of the subscription is shown here too.
- **Enable** — run the service and start it on boot.
- **Choose Profile** — a subscription or an uploaded file.
- **Start Delay** — seconds to wait after the router boots.
- **Scheduled Restart** — by cron, `0 3 * * *` (every day at 3:00) by default.
- **Test Profile** — check the profile with the core before the start (on). If the check fails, the service does not start, the reason is in the core log.
- **Core Only** — run the core with the profile as it is: without the mixin and without the interception rules.
- **Devices**: the mode Exclude: proxy all devices except the selected ones (the default) or Include: proxy only the selected devices, and the devices themselves — by MAC or IP. The IP of a known device is saved as its MAC, so both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic of the device is matched; the IP of an unknown device matches only that address. The selection is stored in Advanced → LAN Proxy → Access Control.

## Profile

Subscriptions (name, subscription URL, subscription info URL, user agent, update interval, Send HWID), the Update and Hard Update buttons, uploading your own profiles. The fields are the same on every platform — see [Subscriptions and profiles](/en/usage/subscriptions/).

## Editor

Editing files: the file for mixin, the profile for startup, profiles, subscriptions, rule and proxy providers.

## Log

The app log and the core log, clearing at stop and scheduled clearing by size. **Debug Log → Generate & Download** builds a report for an issue.

## Update

Installed and latest versions of the packages and the core, free flash space. Update runs the [installer](/en/install/openwrt/#install--update) with the core and the gh-proxy chosen last time; settings, profiles and subscriptions are kept. The low flash space mode removes the current core before installing the new one.

## Advanced

:::caution
For experienced users. Wrong values can break the proxy or the internet access of the whole network.
