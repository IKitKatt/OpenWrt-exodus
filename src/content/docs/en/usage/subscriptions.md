title: Subscriptions and profiles
description: Subscriptions, provider headers and HWID — the same on every platform.
---

A profile is a Mihomo config: a subscription (downloaded by its URL) or an uploaded file. On every start the profile is merged with the settings of Exodus and the mixin file, the result is the profile for startup. How to change the profile over the subscription — on the [Overrides](/en/usage/overrides/) page.

## Subscription fields

| Field | What it sets |
| --- | --- |
| Name | replaced with the title of the provider (`profile-title`) when it sends one |
| URL | the subscription link |
| Info URL | only when traffic and expiry come from another address |
| User agent | `Mihomo/Exodus v{version}` by default, `{version}` is replaced with the version of Exodus |
| Update interval, hours | empty — the interval of the provider (`profile-update-interval`), otherwise every hour; `0` — only by the Update button |
| Send HWID | the [HWID](#hwid) headers, on by default |

- The saved subscription file is used until its interval passes: the start does not wait for the provider.
- The running core gets a changed subscription without a restart (on OpenWrt by reloading the service), connections and chosen proxies are kept. A subscription that fails the check is not applied.
- **Hard update** removes everything downloaded by the rule and proxy providers of the current profile, downloads the subscription again and restarts the service. Files of local providers are kept.

## Provider headers

| Header | What Exodus shows |
| --- | --- |
| `profile-title` | the name of the subscription |
| `announce` | the announce block on the status page |
| `profile-logo` | the logo next to the subscription and in the announce |
| `support-url` | the Support button |
| `subscription-userinfo` | traffic and expiry |
| `profile-update-interval` | the update interval, unless it is set by hand |

## HWID

Panels with a device limit (Remnawave, for example) tell the router from other devices by the `x-hwid`, `x-device-os`, `x-ver-os` and `x-device-model` headers. Exodus sends them by default, turn off Send HWID for a subscription that does not need them.

`x-hwid` is made from the model and the MAC of the router and stays the same after a reinstall or a reset of the settings. It can be set by hand, the other headers are read from the firmware. Where to see the values: Settings → Service → HWID on Keenetic and Asus, Advanced → Proxy Config → Misc on OpenWrt.
